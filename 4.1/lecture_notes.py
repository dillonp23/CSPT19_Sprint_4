"""
* Hash Table Basics:
    - great for searches if we know the key
    - one of most common data structures
        - dictionaries and sets built on top of hash tables
    

    * hashing functions:
        - take in a variable input
            - typically a string
        - deterministic
            - same input always has same resulting output
        - good hashing fxns have minimal duplication of output values
            - want our output to be distributed across a wide range of values
        - hashing should always be constant time to get value for key
