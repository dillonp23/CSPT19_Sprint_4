"""
Exercise 1: Find The Single Number (task 4 of 6)

You are given a non-empty array of integers. One element appears exactly once, with every other element appearing 
at least twice, perhaps more.

Write a function that can find and return the element that appears exactly once.


* Examples:
    Input: [1,1,2,1]
    Output: 2
    Example 2:

    Input: [1,2,1,2,1,2,80]
    Output: 80


* Note: You should be able to develop a solution that has O(n) time complexity.
