Exercise 1: Isomorphic Strings (task 3 of 5)

Given two strings a and b, determine if they are isomorphic.
Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in 'a' can be replaced to get 'b'.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. 
No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.


* Examples:

    1.  Input: 
            a = "odd"
            b = "egg"

        Output: true


    2.  Input:
            a = "foo"
            b = "bar"

        Output: false


    3.  Input:
            a = "abca"
            b = "zbxz"

        Output: true


    4.  Input:
            a = "abc"
            b = ""

        Output: false
